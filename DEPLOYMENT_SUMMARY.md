## 📊 Current Configuration

### Contract Addresses (Temporary)
Currently all chains point to Base contract for UI testing:
```javascript
ETHEREUM: 0x2cCE8fA9C5A369145319EB4906a47B319c639928 (Base contract)
BSC:      0x2cCE8fA9C5A369145319EB4906a47B319c639928 (Base contract)
BASE:     0x2cCE8fA9C5A369145319EB4906a47B319c639928 (Live presale)
```

### When Multi-Chain Contracts Deploy:
Update `src/config/chains.js` with new addresses:
```javascript
export const PRESALE_ADDRESSES = {
  [CHAIN_IDS.ETHEREUM]: "0xYourEthereumPresaleAddress",
  [CHAIN_IDS.BSC]: "0xYourBSCPresaleAddress",
  [CHAIN_IDS.BASE]: "0x2cCE8fA9C5A369145319EB4906a47B319c639928"
};
```

## 🚀 What You Can Do Now

### Immediate (UI Testing)
1. ✅ Visit www.havanaelephant.com
2. ✅ See the new multi-chain UI
3. ✅ Test network switching (Ethereum, BSC, Base)
4. ✅ Test payment token selection
5. ✅ Purchase on Base network (currently live!)

### When Ready to Deploy Real Multi-Chain Contracts

#### Option A: Testnet First (Recommended - FREE)
```bash
cd /Users/davidsime/hvna-ecosystem/smart-contracts

# Get free testnet tokens:
# Sepolia ETH: https://sepoliafaucet.com
# BSC Testnet BNB: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart

# Deploy to testnets
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-presale-ethereum.js --network sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-presale-bsc.js --network bscTestnet

# Test with free tokens
# Update config with testnet addresses
# Verify everything works
```

#### Option B: Mainnet Deployment (Costs Money)
**Requirements:**
- ~0.05 ETH in your deployer wallet (0x12EDd8CA5D79e4f1269E4Ce9e941bD05c4ceeE05) = ~$200
- ~0.1 BNB in same wallet = ~$60
- Total cost: ~$260

**Deploy:**
```bash
# Fund your deployer wallet first!
# Then:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-presale-ethereum.js --network mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-presale-bsc.js --network bsc

# Update src/config/chains.js with new addresses
# Rebuild and redeploy website
npm run build
# Push to Git for auto-deployment
```
