**What Needs Fixing:**
- ❌ ETH/USD price feed (using mainnet feed, not Sepolia feed)
- ⚠️ Sale phases ended (need to extend or re-deploy)

## 🔴 What's Not Live Yet

### 🔷 Ethereum Mainnet
- **Status:** ❌ **NOT DEPLOYED**
- **Reason:** Waiting for budget (~$200 deployment cost)
- **Ready to Deploy:** ✅ Script ready, contract compiled
- **Command:** `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-presale-ethereum.js --network mainnet`

### 🟡 BSC Mainnet
- **Status:** ❌ **NOT DEPLOYED**
- **Reason:** Waiting for budget (~$60 deployment cost)
- **Ready to Deploy:** ✅ Script ready, contract compiled
- **Command:** `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-presale-bsc.js --network bsc`

### 🟡 BSC Testnet
- **Status:** ❌ **NOT DEPLOYED**
- **Reason:** Need BSC testnet BNB
- **Ready to Deploy:** ✅ Script ready, contract compiled
- **Get Testnet BNB:** https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
- **Command:** `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-presale-bsc.js --network bscTestnet`

## 🔧 Issues to Fix

### Issue 1: Sepolia Price Feed
**Problem:** Current Sepolia contract uses mainnet Chainlink feed, causing ETH price lookups to fail

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Redeploy (Recommended)**
1. Get more Sepolia ETH (need 0.01 more, currently have 0.0445, need 0.054)
2. Redeploy with correct Chainlink feed: `0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306`
3. Update frontend config with new address

**Where to Get More Sepolia ETH:**
- https://sepoliafaucet.com
- https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia
- https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de

**Deploy Command:**
```bash
cd /Users/davidsime/hvna-ecosystem/smart-contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-presale-ethereum.js --network sepolia
```

**Option B: Keep Current (Not Recommended)**
- USDT payments work fine (direct pricing)
- ETH payments won't work
- Can still test purchase flow with USDT

### Issue 2: Sale Phases Ended
**Problem:** Current phases:
- Genesis: October 29 - November 5
- Public: November 5 - December 5
- Current: Shows "ENDED"

**Solution:** Redeploy with new phases (automatically set to start "now" + 7/30 days)

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Sepolia Testnet Test Results

**Test Date:** October 29, 2025

**✅ Working:**
- Contract deployment
