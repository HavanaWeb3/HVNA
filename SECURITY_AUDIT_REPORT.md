## 2. Critical Vulnerabilities Found & Fixed

### 2.1 ❌ CRITICAL: Private Key Exposure (RESOLVED)

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Issue:**
- Original deployment wallet private key was exposed in code repository
- Wallet: `0x0099B85B9a5f117AfB7877A36D4BBe0388DD0F66`
- Private key visible in GitHub commit history

**Impact:**
- Total asset loss risk: 100M HVNA tokens + ETH
- Attacker could drain all funds
- Complete compromise of ecosystem

**Resolution:**
- Created new secure wallet: `0x12EDd8CA5D79e4f1269E4Ce9e941bD05c4ceeE05`
- Deployed new token contract with fresh 100M supply
- All previous contracts abandoned
- Private key removed from repository
- Git history cleaned using filter-branch

**Verification:**
```bash
# New wallet has full control
Owner: 0x12EDd8CA5D79e4f1269E4Ce9e941bD05c4ceeE05
Token Balance: 75,001,000 HVNA
Old Wallet: 0 HVNA (fully migrated)
```

---

### 2.2 ❌ HIGH: Incorrect Genesis NFT Reference (RESOLVED)

**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Issue:**
- First presale deployed with wrong NFT contract: `0x815D1bfaF945aCa39049FF243D6E406e2aEc3ff5`
- This NFT's `balanceOf()` function always reverts
- Caused ALL purchase attempts to fail with "execution reverted"
- No users could buy tokens

**Root Cause:**
```solidity
function isGenesisHolder(address user) public view returns (bool) {
    return genesisNFT.balanceOf(user) > 0; // ❌ Reverts!
}

function buyTokens(uint256 tokenAmount) public payable {
    bool isGenesis = isGenesisHolder(msg.sender); // ❌ Transaction fails here
    // ... rest of function never executes
}
```

**Impact:**
- Zero revenue - no one could purchase
- Poor user experience
- Potential reputation damage

**Resolution:**
- Deployed new presale with correct NFT: `0x84bb6c7Bf82EE8c455643A7D613F9B160aeC0642`
- Tested NFT contract - `balanceOf()` works correctly
- Recovered 25M tokens from broken presale

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test NFT contract
Correct NFT: 0x84bb6c7Bf82EE8c455643A7D613F9B160aeC0642
Name: Boldly Elephunky
Symbol: BELENFT
balanceOf(test_address): ✅ Returns 0 (no revert)
```

---

### 2.3 ❌ HIGH: Incorrect Token Pricing (RESOLVED)

**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Issue:**
- `tokenPriceUSDCents` set to 100 cents ($1.00)
- Correct price: 1 cent ($0.01)
- **Users charged 100x the intended price**

**Impact:**
- Price per 1000 tokens: $1,000 instead of $10
- Required 0.222 ETH (~$1,000) instead of 0.0022 ETH (~$10)
- Complete pricing failure

**Root Cause:**
```solidity
// ❌ WRONG - Comment is incorrect
uint256 public tokenPriceUSDCents = 100; // $0.01 = 100 cents

// ✅ CORRECT - $0.01 = 1 cent (not 100 cents!)
uint256 public tokenPriceUSDCents = 1;
```

**Resolution:**
- Called `setPricing(1, 30)` to correct price
- Transaction: `0xa433dde6ae8e6e01f1ae6878e9d77d3a25b57672a7d3062ce4c56665f45669db`
- Verified calculation:
  - 1000 tokens × $0.01 = $10
  - $10 ÷ $4,504 (ETH price) = 0.0022 ETH ✅

---

### 2.4 ⚠️ MEDIUM: No Vesting Mechanism (RESOLVED)

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Issue:**
- Original contract sent tokens immediately to buyer
- No protection against market dump at trading launch
- No gradual token distribution

**Impact:**
- Risk of 25M tokens dumping at launch
- Severe downward price pressure
- Poor tokenomics

**Resolution:**
- Deployed new `TokenPreSaleVesting` contract
- Implements 3-stage vesting:
  - **40%** at trading launch
  - **40%** after 3 months
  - **20%** after 6 months
- Tokens locked in contract until owner enables vesting

**Code Implementation:**
```solidity
function buyTokens(uint256 tokenAmount) public payable {
    // Records purchase, doesn't transfer tokens
    purchasedAmount[msg.sender] += tokenAmount;
    tokensSold += tokenAmount;
    // Tokens stay in contract ✅
}

function claimTokens() public {
    require(vestingEnabled, "Vesting not enabled yet");
    uint256 vestedAmount = getVestedAmount(msg.sender);
    uint256 claimable = vestedAmount - claimedAmount[msg.sender];

    claimedAmount[msg.sender] += claimable;
    hvnaToken.transfer(msg.sender, claimable); // Transfer only vested amount
}
```

## 3. Security Best Practices Implemented

### 3.1 Access Control
✅ **Owner-Only Functions:**
- `toggleSale()` - Start/stop presale
- `enableVesting()` - Begin token distribution
- `withdrawETH()` - Collect presale revenue
- `setPricing()` - Update token pricing
- `withdrawUnsoldTokens()` - Recover unsold tokens

✅ **Modifiers:**
```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
    _;
}
```

### 3.2 Input Validation
✅ **Purchase Limits:**
- Minimum purchase: 1,000 tokens
- Maximum (Genesis): 50,000 tokens
- Maximum (Public): 25,000 tokens

✅ **Sale Constraints:**
```solidity
require(tokenAmount > 0, "Token amount must be greater than 0");
require(tokenAmount >= minPurchase, "Below minimum purchase amount");
require(tokensSold + tokenAmount <= maxTokensForPreSale, "Exceeds limit");
require(msg.value >= ethCost, "Insufficient ETH sent");
```

### 3.3 Oracle Integration
✅ **Chainlink Price Feed:**
- Address: `0x71041dddad3595F9CEd3DcCFBe3D1F4b0a16Bb70`
- Provides real-time ETH/USD pricing
- 8 decimal precision

```solidity
function getETHUSDPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
    require(price > 0, "Invalid price feed");
    return uint256(price);
}
```

### 3.4 Refund Mechanism
✅ **Excess ETH Returned:**
```solidity
if (msg.value > ethCost) {
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(msg.value - ethCost);
}
```
