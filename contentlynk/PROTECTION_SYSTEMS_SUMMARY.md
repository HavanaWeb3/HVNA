## 🛡️ Protection System Details

### System 1-3: Foundation Security
**Status:** Previously Deployed
**Features:**
- Multi-factor authentication
- Rate limiting (IP-based)
- Signup fraud prevention
- Email/phone verification
- Password reset system

**Mode Behavior:** Not mode-dependent

---

### System 4: Engagement Velocity Monitoring
**Status:** ✅ Deployed
**Documentation:** [VELOCITY_MONITORING_REPORT.md](./VELOCITY_MONITORING_REPORT.md)

#### What It Does
Detects when posts receive engagement too quickly (bot attacks) and when creators give engagement too quickly (bot behavior).

#### Mode-Aware Thresholds

**BETA Mode (Current):**
- Threshold: **50 engagements/hour**
- Action: **Auto-flag and hold earnings**
- Philosophy: Suspicious until proven innocent

**NATURAL Mode (Future):**
- Warning threshold: **200 engagements/hour**
- Extreme threshold: **500 engagements/hour**
- Action: **Issue warnings, hold only extremes**
- Philosophy: Innocent until proven guilty

#### Key Features
- ✅ Progressive 4-strike warning system
- ✅ 30-day warning expiry
- ✅ Automatic probation (7 days) on Strike 3
- ✅ Account suspension on Strike 4
- ✅ Cron job releases held earnings after review period
- ✅ Admin API endpoints for warning management

#### Database Tables
- `creator_warnings` - Strike tracking
- `flagged_content` - Content under review
- `users` - Added status, probation, suspension fields
- `earnings` - Added hold fields

#### Files Deployed
```
src/config/detection-thresholds.ts
src/config/platform-mode.ts
src/lib/velocity-monitor.ts
src/lib/warning-system.ts
src/app/api/admin/warnings/route.ts
src/app/api/cron/release-held-earnings/route.ts
src/__tests__/velocity-monitoring.test.ts
```

### System 5: Engagement Source Diversity
**Status:** ✅ Deployed
**Documentation:** [DIVERSITY_MONITORING_REPORT.md](./DIVERSITY_MONITORING_REPORT.md)

#### What It Does
Detects when posts get most of their engagement from a small group of users (gaming pods).

#### Mode-Aware Thresholds

**BETA Mode (Current):**
- Threshold: **>50% from top 10 engagers**
- Action: **Apply 0.5x penalty (50% earnings reduction)**
- Philosophy: Concentrated engagement = gaming

**NATURAL Mode (Future):**
- Warning threshold: **>95% from top 10 engagers**
- Action: **Issue warning only (no penalty)**
- Philosophy: Trust tight-knit communities

#### Key Features
- ✅ HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) concentration measurement
- ✅ Gaming pod detection algorithm
- ✅ Platform-wide diversity analytics
- ✅ Top engager breakdown for admin review
- ✅ Automatic penalties in BETA, warnings in NATURAL

#### Database Tables
- `posts` - Added diversity tracking fields:
  - `diversity_score` - Calculated multiplier
  - `top10_percentage` - Concentration metric
  - `diversity_penalty` - Applied penalty (if any)
  - `last_diversity_check` - Timestamp

#### Files Deployed
```

### System 6: Network Graph Analysis
**Status:** 🚧 Roadmap for Phase 2
**Target:** Q1 2026 (after Systems 4-5 proven effective)

#### Planned Features
- Build network graph from engagement patterns
- Detect communities using connected components
- Calculate suspicion score (0-100) based on:
  - Density (30 points)
  - Reciprocity (25 points)
  - Earnings ratio (15 points)
  - Timing correlation (30 points)
- Mode-aware handling:
  - BETA: Score >70 = hold earnings
  - NATURAL: Score >85 = warn, >95 or 2+ warnings = hold
- Appeal system for NATURAL mode
- Daily cron job analysis

#### Why Phase 2?
1. **Complexity** - Requires graph algorithms and ML expertise
2. **Data Requirements** - Need baseline metrics from Systems 4-5 first
3. **Testing** - Extensive testing needed to avoid false positives
4. **UI Required** - Appeals system needs admin dashboard

#### Configuration Ready
Detection thresholds already updated with:
- BETA: `suspicionThreshold: 70`, `action: 'HOLD'`, `allowAppeals: false`
- NATURAL: `suspicionThreshold: 85`, `action: 'WARN'`, `allowAppeals: true`

## 🔄 Mode Switching Strategy

### Current Mode: BETA

**Characteristics:**
- Strict thresholds (50/hr velocity, 50% diversity)
- Immediate penalties and holds
- No appeals process
- Aggressive bot detection

**When to Use:**
- Platform launch phase
- High fraud risk period
- Testing new protection systems
- Building baseline data

### Future Mode: NATURAL

**Characteristics:**
- Lenient thresholds (200/hr velocity, 95% diversity)
- Warnings before penalties
- Appeals process active
- Trust communities

**When to Switch:**
- Platform is stable (6+ months)
- False positive rate < 5%
- Sufficient data collected
- Legitimate communities established

### How to Switch

**Environment Variable:**
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard, set:
PLATFORM_MODE=NATURAL

# Or keep default (BETA):
PLATFORM_MODE=BETA
```

**Gradual Rollout (Recommended):**
1. Run BETA for 3 months
2. Analyze flagged content (true vs false positives)
3. Adjust thresholds in `detection-thresholds.ts`
4. Switch to NATURAL mode
5. Monitor for 2 weeks
6. Adjust as needed

## 📈 Key Metrics to Monitor

### System Health

1. **Flagged Content Rate**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as flagged_today
   FROM flagged_content
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
     AND resolved = false;
   ```

2. **Active Warnings**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as active_warnings
   FROM creator_warnings
   WHERE cleared_at IS NULL
     AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
   ```

3. **Users on Probation**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as on_probation
   FROM users
   WHERE status = 'PROBATION'
     AND probation_until > NOW();
   ```

4. **Held Earnings**
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(amount) as total_held,
          COUNT(*) as earnings_held
   FROM earnings
   WHERE held_until IS NOT NULL
     AND is_paid = false;
   ```

5. **Average Diversity Score**
   ```sql

## 🔧 Operational Procedures

### Daily Monitoring (First 30 Days)

**Morning Check (9 AM):**
1. Check Vercel logs for errors
2. Review flagged content from yesterday
3. Check held earnings queue
4. Monitor for user complaints

**Queries to Run:**
```sql
-- Today's flags
SELECT reason, COUNT(*) as count
FROM flagged_content
WHERE created_at > CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY reason;

-- Warnings issued today
SELECT reason, COUNT(*) as count
FROM creator_warnings
WHERE created_at > CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY reason;

-- Held earnings by reason
SELECT hold_reason, COUNT(*) as count, SUM(amount) as total
FROM earnings
WHERE held_until IS NOT NULL AND is_paid = false
GROUP BY hold_reason;
```

### Weekly Review (Every Monday)

1. **Analyze False Positives**
   - Review all manually cleared flags
   - Identify patterns in legitimate content flagged
   - Adjust thresholds if needed

2. **System Performance**
   - Calculate false positive rate
   - Calculate bot detection rate
   - Review user feedback

3. **Threshold Tuning**
   - Too many flags? Increase thresholds
   - Bots getting through? Decrease thresholds
   - Document all changes

### Monthly Report

**Metrics to Include:**
- Total flags issued
- False positive rate
- Bot accounts detected and suspended
- Earnings held vs released
- User appeals (Phase 2)

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Legitimate content flagged
**Solution:** Manually clear flag via admin API
```bash
DELETE /api/admin/warnings?warningId={id}
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
```

#### Issue: Cron job not releasing earnings
**Check:**
1. Verify cron job configured in Vercel
2. Check CRON_SECRET environment variable
3. Review flagged_content for unresolved flags
4. Check user status (suspended/probation)

#### Issue: High false positive rate (>10%)
**Action:**
1. Review sample of flagged content
2. Identify common patterns
3. Adjust thresholds in `detection-thresholds.ts`
4. Redeploy and monitor

### Emergency Procedures

**If systems need to be disabled:**
```bash
# Set extremely high thresholds (effectively disable)
# In detection-thresholds.ts:
BETA: {
  engagementVelocity: { velocity: 9999 },
  engagementDiversity: { diversityThreshold: 100 }
}

# Then redeploy
```

**If earnings need immediate release:**
```sql
-- Release all held earnings
UPDATE earnings
SET held_until = NULL, hold_reason = NULL
WHERE is_paid = false AND held_until IS NOT NULL;
```

## 🎓 Team Training

### For Content Moderators

**What to Look For:**
1. **High Velocity Flags** - Post got 50+ engagements in 1 hour
   - Check: Is content viral-worthy or bot attack?
   - Action: Clear flag if legitimate viral content

2. **Low Diversity Flags** - 50%+ engagement from same 10 users
   - Check: Are users friends/family or gaming pod?
   - Action: Clear flag if small creator with loyal fans

3. **Network Flags** (Phase 2) - Community detected as suspicious
   - Check: Discord group, subreddit, or gaming pod?
   - Action: Approve appeal if legitimate community

### For Developers

**How to Adjust Thresholds:**
```typescript
// In src/config/detection-thresholds.ts
BETA: {
  engagementVelocity: {
    velocity: 50,  // Increase to 75 if too many flags
  },
  engagementDiversity: {
    diversityThreshold: 50,  // Increase to 60 for less strict
  }
}
```

**How to Test Locally:**
```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm test -- velocity-monitoring.test.ts
npm test -- diversity-monitoring.test.ts

# Check type errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```
