## Form Integration Status

### Current State
‚ö†Ô∏è **Form is client-side only** - Needs backend integration

The beta application form currently:
- ‚úÖ Collects all required data
- ‚úÖ Validates inputs
- ‚úÖ Shows success/error messages
- ‚ùå Does NOT save submissions (needs backend)

### Fields Collected
- Full Name
- Email Address
- Current Platform (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Other)
- Content Niche
- Typical Monthly Posts
- Average Post Engagement
- Why join Contentlynk beta

### Next Steps for Form
You'll need to add backend integration. Options:
1. **API Route:** Create `/src/app/api/beta-applications/route.ts`
2. **Database:** Save to Prisma database (already configured in contentlynk)
3. **Email:** Send notification emails via Resend/SendGrid
4. **Webhook:** Forward to external service (Airtable, Google Sheets, etc.)

Example backend route:
```typescript
// src/app/api/beta-applications/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const data = await request.json()

  // Save to database
  const application = await prisma.betaApplication.create({
    data: {
      name: data.name,
      email: data.email,
      platform: data.platform,
      niche: data.niche,
      posts: parseInt(data.posts),
      engagement: data.engagement,
      reason: data.reason,
      createdAt: new Date()
    }
  })

  // Send notification email
  // await sendEmail(...)

  return NextResponse.json({ success: true })
}
```
