# 🚀 Q4 Token Pre-Sale Launch Checklist

## ❌ **Current Status: NOT READY**

While the code foundation is complete, several critical deployment steps remain before going live.

## 📋 **Pre-Launch Requirements**

### 🔴 **Phase 1: Smart Contract Deployment** 
**Status: NOT DEPLOYED**

#### Required Actions:
- [ ] Deploy `HVNAToken.sol` to Base network (if not already deployed)
- [ ] Deploy `TokenPreSaleBase.sol` to Base network
- [ ] Deploy `DiscountManager.sol` to Base network
- [ ] Verify all contracts on BaseScan
- [ ] Fund pre-sale contract with 15M HVNA tokens
- [ ] Test contract functions with real wallets

**Estimated Time: 1-2 days**

### 🔴 **Phase 2: API Infrastructure**
**Status: NOT DEPLOYED**

#### Required Actions:
- [ ] Deploy discount verification API to production server
- [ ] Configure Base network RPC endpoints
- [ ] Set up monitoring and error logging
- [ ] Test API endpoints with real token holders
- [ ] Configure rate limiting and security

**Estimated Time: 2-3 days**

### 🔴 **Phase 3: Shopify Integration**
**Status: NOT INTEGRATED**

#### Required Actions:
- [ ] Add wallet connect functionality to checkout
- [ ] Integrate token balance verification
- [ ] Test dual discount system (NFT + Token)
- [ ] Configure automatic discount code application
- [ ] Beta test with Genesis holders

**Estimated Time: 3-4 days**

### 🔴 **Phase 4: Testing & Validation**
**Status: NOT TESTED**

#### Required Actions:
- [ ] End-to-end testing with real users
- [ ] Validate token purchase → instant discount flow
- [ ] Test edge cases (network failures, wallet disconnects)
- [ ] Performance testing under load
- [ ] Security audit of discount system

**Estimated Time: 1-2 weeks**

## ⏰ **Realistic Launch Timeline**

### **Week 1-2: Technical Implementation**
- Smart contract deployment and testing
- API development and deployment
- Basic Shopify integration

### **Week 3: Integration & Testing**
- End-to-end system testing
- Beta testing with Genesis holders
- Bug fixes and optimizations

### **Week 4: Launch Preparation**
- Final security checks
- Marketing materials preparation
- Launch day coordination

### **🎯 Earliest Launch Date: 3-4 weeks from now**

## 🚨 **Critical Dependencies**

### **You Need to Provide:**
1. **Base Network RPC URL** (Infura, Alchemy, or similar)
2. **Deployed contract addresses** (NFT, Token if they exist)
3. **Shopify store access** for integration testing
4. **Launch date preferences** for Q4 timeline
5. **Marketing coordination** with development timeline

### **Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Deploy to Base Testnet first** for safe testing
2. **Get Genesis holder volunteers** for beta testing
3. **Set up production infrastructure** (servers, domains)
4. **Plan marketing launch** around technical readiness

## 💡 **Pre-Launch Checklist**

### ✅ **What's Ready:**
- Smart contract code complete
- API architecture designed  
- Shopify integration planned
- Discount logic implemented
- Documentation complete

### ❌ **What's Missing:**
- Actual deployment to Base network
- Live API endpoints
- Shopify checkout integration
- Real-world testing
- Production infrastructure

## 🎯 **To Answer Your Question:**

**"Are we ready to make token purchases live?"**
- **Code**: ✅ Ready
- **Deployment**: ❌ Not yet
- **Integration**: ❌ Not yet
- **Testing**: ❌ Not yet

**"Will discounts be available immediately after token purchase?"**
- **System Design**: ✅ Yes, designed for instant verification
- **Implementation**: ❌ Requires deployment and integration first

## 🚀 **Recommended Action Plan**

### **Option 1: Full Production Launch**
- Complete all 4 phases above
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks
- Result: Fully integrated system

### **Option 2: Phased Launch**
- **Phase A**: Token pre-sale only (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase B**: Add Shopify discounts (2-3 weeks later)
- Advantage: Generate token sales faster

### **Option 3: Beta Launch**
- Deploy to testnet first
- Limited Genesis holder testing
- Gather feedback before mainnet
- Timeline: 2 weeks testing + 2 weeks production

## 💰 **Financial Considerations**

### **Deployment Costs:**
- Base network gas fees: ~$50-200
- Server hosting: ~$50-100/month
- Development time: 20-40 hours

### **Revenue Impact:**
- Token sales can start immediately after Phase 1
- Shopify integration adds customer retention value
- Discount system drives repeat purchases

## 🎉 **The Foundation is Solid**

Your token pre-sale system is **architecturally complete** and ready for deployment. The code handles:
- ✅ USD pricing with ETH conversion
- ✅ Base network compatibility  
- ✅ Genesis NFT authentication
- ✅ Dual discount verification
- ✅ Real-time balance checking

**Next step**: Choose your launch strategy and begin Phase 1 deployment!
