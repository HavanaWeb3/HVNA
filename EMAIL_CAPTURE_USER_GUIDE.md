# Email Capture System - User Guide

## Overview
Your website now automatically captures customer emails after token/NFT purchases to help you build your email list and project community.

---

## When Email Capture Happens

### 1. Token Purchases (HVNA Token)
**Trigger:** Immediately after successful purchase transaction

**User Flow:**
1. Customer purchases HVNA tokens on havanaelephant.com
2. Transaction completes successfully on blockchain
3. Success message appears: "üéâ $HVNA tokens purchased successfully!"
4. **Email capture dialog automatically pops up**
5. Dialog shows:
   - Header: "Stay Connected!" with envelope icon
   - Message: "Join our community to receive updates about your purchase, exclusive offers, and project news"
   - Email input field
   - Two buttons: "Join Community" or "Skip"

**Customer Options:**
- **Enter email & click "Join Community"** ‚Üí Email saved, success animation shows, dialog closes after 2 seconds
- **Click "Skip"** ‚Üí Dialog closes immediately, no email saved

---

### 2. NFT Purchases (Boldly Elephunky)
**Trigger:** When customer connects wallet and owns NFTs

**User Flow:**
1. Customer purchases Boldly Elephunky NFT on OpenSea (external)
2. Customer returns to havanaelephant.com
3. Customer clicks "Connect MetaMask" button
4. Wallet connects successfully
5. System detects customer owns NFT(s)
6. **Email capture dialog automatically pops up**
7. Same dialog interface as token purchases

**Why This Timing:**
Since NFTs are purchased on OpenSea (not your site), we can't detect the purchase in real-time. Instead, we detect when NFT holders connect their wallet to your site.
